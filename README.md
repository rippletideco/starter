  <h1>👋 Welcome to Rippletide!</h1>
</div>

Welcome to the Rippletide Starter repository! This repository contains the complete documentation for the Rippletide platform, including an hypergraph database system designed for AI Agents.
Rippletide Hypergraph is a database that encompasses knowledge and decision-making for AI Agents. It provides:

- **Block and Reduce Hallucinations**: Under 1% hallucination rate
- **Guardrail Compliance**: 100% adherence to defined guardrails
- **Full Explainability**: Complete transparency in decision-making processes

The platform uses a neuro-symbolic reasoning engine at its core to make decisions, such as determining the best sequence of actions to achieve objectives or quantitatively evaluating which external tools to use and in what order.

## Quick Start

Get started with **[Rippletide Trust Platform](https://eval.rippletide.com/)** in no time!  

After creating your account, you can start building, testing, and optimizing your agents in two ways:

- **API Power:** Create an API key and take full control programmatically. Use the [API documentation](https://docs.rippletide.com/api-reference/introduction) or the Python helper to integrate your agents directly into your projects.
- **Visual Interface:** Prefer clicks over code? Manage, test, and fine-tune your agents right from the platform’s intuitive UI.

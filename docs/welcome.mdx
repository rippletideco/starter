# Welcome

Rippletide hypergraph is a database encompassing the knowledge and decision making for AI Agents, it:
- reduces hallucinatons under 1%, 
- ensures 100% of the guardrails are followed 
- provides full explainability.

This SDK is only a snippet of Rippletide's technology, partly removing LLMs from the decision making.

In the full version of Rippletide technology, no decisions are made using an LLM.
LLMs can be used only to parse input queries, leveraging language understanding capabilities, or to put in words an answer for the user. This time leveraging language generation capabilities.

A neuro-symbolic reasoning engine is present at the core of the database to make the decisions, such as what is the best sequence of actions to achieve the objective or to quantitatively evaluate which external tools to use and in what order.

Those capabilities require a deeper data modelling setup, thus available only for larger and high stake Agent projects.

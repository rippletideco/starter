# Create your Hypergraph

## Overview

Rippletide provides a comprehensive set of APIs for managing and interacting with agents, knowledge bases, and
conversation flows. All the resources that can be created are here to create an agent with less than 1% hallucinations.

## Hypergraph Concepts

For an easier setup in this SDK, we wrapped high level concepts:

- **[Q&A](/api-reference/introduction#tag/QAndA)** : what are the questions and answers the Agent should know to perform the use case?
- **[Tags](/api-reference/introduction#tag/Tag)** : define the glossary topics and tag your Q&A
- Possible **[actions](/api-reference/introduction#tag/Action)** for the Agent and requirements
- Define **[state and transitions](/api-reference/introduction#tag/State-Predicate)**

In the core Rippletide technology data structures may be implemented in a different manner and complemented by a data coherence check. 

That means when a new data is updated within the graph, the implications in other areas will be evaluated to cascade updates.

A build UI and a run UI will soonly be available.

## Example: Order taking Agent

### Q&A
Q - What products can be ordered?
A - You can order our last Samsung TV RED43

Q - What is the price?
A - The Samsung TV RED43 costs $990

Q - How long will it take for my order to be delivered?
A - You Samsung TV can be delivered the next day

...

**API Reference**: [Q&A Management](/api-reference/introduction#tag/QAndA) - Create, update, and manage your Q&A pairs

### Tags

Glossary:
	High-tech products
	Delivery date
	Pricing
	Discount
	Purchase history

Tags:
	High-tech products : all products in high-tech category
	Delivery date : the date the customer will receive his product
	Purchase history : the list of all product bought
	Discount : all types of discount that can apply on products


Tag the Q&A:
Q- What is the price?
A - The Samsung TV RED43 costs $990
Tags: High-tech products, Discount

**API Reference**: [Tag Management](/api-reference/introduction#tag/Tag) - Create and manage tags for organizing your knowledge base

### Possible actions for the Agent and requirements

Answer a question about a product
	Requirement : get access the the product documentation

Add a product to the cart
	Requirement : at least one product chosen

Check out
	Requirement : At least one product in the cart
	Requirement : The discount has been applied on the price

Open a ticket when the Agent can not answer
	Requirement : method to contact back the user (email / phone)

Book a meeting with a sales person
	Requirement : Sales person availability

**API Reference**: [Action Management](/api-reference/introduction#tag/Action) - Define and manage actions your agent can perform

## Define States and Transitions

State : The user described his needs
	Transitions : recommend a product, describe discount mechanism

State : A product has been chosen
	Transitions : Ask a delivery date, checking out, add a discount, delete the product

State : The user has asked to change the delivery address
	Transition : check if order has been already expedited, ask for the new address


State : The user described his needs
	Transitions : recommend a product, described discount mechanism

State : A product has been chosen
	Transitions : Ask a delivery date, checking out, add a discount, delete the product

	State : A product has been removed from the cart
	Transition : pick a new product

	State : The user has asked to change the delivery address
	Transition : check if order has been already expedited, ask for the new address

**API Reference**: [State Predicate Management](/api-reference/introduction#tag/State-Predicate) - Configure state transitions and agent behavior based on available information

## Next Steps

Once you've defined your hypergraph concepts, you can:

1. **Create your Agent**: [Agent Management API](/api-reference/introduction#tag/Agent) - Set up your conversational AI agent
2. **Start Chatting**: [Chat API](/api-reference/introduction#tag/Chat) - Interact with your agent through the chat interface
3. **Add Guardrails**: [Guardrails API](/api-reference/introduction#tag/Guardrails) - Ensure your agent operates within safe boundaries

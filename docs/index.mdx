Rippletide is a hypergraph database that powers AI Agents with deterministic decision-making capabilities.

### Key Benefits
- **< 1% hallucinations** - Dramatically reduces AI errors
- **100% guardrail compliance** - Ensures all safety rules are followed
- **Full explainability** - Understand every decision your agent makes
- **Comprehensive evaluation** - Test and validate agent performance

### How It Works

Unlike traditional LLM-based agents, Rippletide uses a neuro-symbolic reasoning engine for decision-making:

- **LLMs** are used only for language understanding (parsing queries) and generation (formulating responses)
- **Decision-making** is handled by our deterministic reasoning engine
- **Actions** are selected based on quantitative evaluation, not probabilistic generation

This approach ensures reliable, explainable, and safe AI agent behavior.

    "question": "How do you manage scope creep?",
    "answer": "Track change request, assess impact, propose trade-offs (time/cost/scope), and require explicit decision."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you manage dependencies?",
    "answer": "Identify, assign owner, set due date, define interface/contract, track in dependency log."

    "answer": "Milestone-based with buffers; expose critical path; provide confidence levels (high/med/low)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you handle ambiguous requirements?",
    "answer": "Convert into assumptions; list validation tasks; define a timebox for discovery; avoid building without acceptance criteria."
